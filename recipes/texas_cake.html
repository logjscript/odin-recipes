        <h3>Directions</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F and grease a 18x13'' pan.</li>

            <li>Add water butter cocoa powder to a medium saucepan over medium heat. Bring mixture to a boil.</li>

            <li>Meanwhile, in a separate bowl mix together the flour, sugar baking soda and salt. </li>

            <li>In another small bowl mix together the sour cream, eggs and vanilla. </li>

            <li>Add sour cream/egg mixture to the flour mixture and mix until combined. </li>

            <li>Once the chocolate mixture in the saucepan in boiling, remove it from heat and pour it into the batter. Mix until combined and no lumps remain.</li>

            <li>Pour mixture into prepared pan and smooth with a spatula to make sure it is dispersed in an even layer.</li>

            <li> Bake in preheated oven for 15-20 minutes or until set (mine is usually done around 15 minutes).</li>

            <li>When the cake is about half-way through cooking, prepare the frosting.</li>

            <li>For the Chocolate Sheet Cake Frosting</li>

            <li>Add milk, cocoa and butter to a saucepan. Bring mixture to a boil. </li>

            <li>Once boiling, remove it from the heat and stir in powdered sugar. I like to beat the mixture with my hand-held mixer to get rid of any lumps. </li>

            <li>Pour hot icing over hot cake. Use a spatula to spread it evenly over the cake. Allow frosting to set for about 10 minutes before eating.</li>
        </ol>
